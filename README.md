# NotionPaper
NotionPaper is tool that helps you generate static sites from Notion, so that you can use Notion like a CMS.

## Why NotionPaper
My initial thoughts are simple: I want a blogging platform that is simple and good to use enough, so that I could focus on writing instead of setting up a bulky environment. 

Notion is the perfect tool for that, however you need to pay some money on the subscription in order to let search engines to crawl your site. And I don't wanna spend money on that.

I've used many blogging platforms such as Hexo, Wordpress and etc., you can find my comparison among those platforms and why NotionPaper is a better choice on my blog.
